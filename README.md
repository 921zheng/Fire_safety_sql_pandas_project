###Fire Safety SQL and Pandas Project

###Description

This project leverages SQL and Python to analyze fire safety data. The goal is to gain insights into fire incidents, response times, and safety measures. By using SQL for data retrieval and Python for data analysis and visualization, we can uncover patterns and trends that are crucial for improving fire safety protocols.

###Technologies

SQL: Used for querying and managing the fire safety data stored in a database.
Python: Utilized for data analysis and visualization, primarily through the Pandas library.

###Features

Data Extraction: Efficiently extracting relevant fire safety data using SQL queries.
Data Analysis: Using Python and Pandas to perform comprehensive data analysis.
Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to represent the findings.
